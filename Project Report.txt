📄 PROJECT REPORT

UPI QR CODE GENERATOR


---

1. Introduction

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is one of the most widely used digital payment platforms in India. With the rapid growth of QR-based payments, users prefer scanning QR rather than typing UPI IDs.
This project provides a Python-based solution to generate QR codes automatically for different UPI applications including PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay.


---

2. Problem Statement

Users often need multiple QR codes to receive payments from different platforms. Creating QR codes manually for each platform is time-consuming.
This project solves the problem by automating QR code generation using a single UPI ID.

3. Objectives

✔ Generate QR codes automatically for PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay
✔ Save QR codes as images locally
✔ Display generated QR codes instantly for preview

4. Tools and Technologies Used

Tool / Library	Purpose

Python	Programming
qrcode	Generate QR codes
Pillow (PIL)	Display QR code images



---

5. Workflow

1️⃣ User enters their UPI ID
2️⃣ Script generates UPI payment URLs for each application
3️⃣ QR codes are created using the qrcode library
4️⃣ QR codes are saved and displayed to user

6. Source Code

import qrcode

upi_id = input("Enter your UPI ID= ")

phonepe_url = f'upi://pay?pa={upi_id}&pn=Recipient%20Name&mc=1234'
paytm_url = f'upi://pay?pa={upi_id}&pn=Recipient%20Name&mc=1234'
google_pay_url = f'upi://pay?pa={upi_id}&pn=Recipient%20Name&mc=1234'

phonepe_qr = qrcode.make(phonepe_url)
paytm_qr = qrcode.make(paytm_url)
google_pay_qr = qrcode.make(google_pay_url)

phonepe_qr.save("phonepe_qr.png")
paytm_qr.save("paytm_qr.png")
google_pay_qr.save("google_pay_qr.png")

phonepe_qr.show()
paytm_qr.show()
google_pay_qr.show()

7. Testing

Multiple UPI IDs were tested.
All QR images opened successfully and supported payments on PhonePe, Paytm & Google Pay.


---

8. Challenges Faced

• Correct UPI URL formatting for multiple apps
• Library installation on different systems (qrcode / PIL)


---

9. Learnings

• Understanding UPI protocol format (upi://pay?pa=...)
• Using Python for QR code generation and image handling


---

10. Future Enhancements

🔹 Support more UPI applications
🔹 Add GUI using Tkinter
🔹 Add personalised logo/branding on QR codes


---

11. Conclusion

This project successfully automates QR code generation for digital payments and makes receiving payments more efficient and convenient across multiple UPI platforms.
